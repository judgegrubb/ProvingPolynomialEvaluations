# A Protocol for Proving Polynomial Evaluations

Implementation of a coding challenge I'm working on for an internship position.
Implements a not-very-good verified computing protocol.

Fun opportunity to brush up on my C++ knowledge! 

Requires [Victor Shoup's Library for Number Theory](https://www.shoup.net/ntl/)
and all the prereqs involved there.
